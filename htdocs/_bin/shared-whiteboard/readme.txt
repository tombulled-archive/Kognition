Shared Whiteboard is a WordPress plugin that makes it easy to add interactive
whiteboards to your posts and pages.

== Description ==

Shared Whiteboard is a WordPress plugin that makes it easy to add interactive
whiteboards to your posts and pages. The whiteboards are compatible with
desktop browsers, tablets and mobile phones.

The plugin supports two kinds of whiteboards: standalone and shared.

= Standalone whiteboards =

Standalone whiteboard is a whiteboard that any visitor can use to draw and
post (or save) images, but each visitor only sees what they draw (there is
no sharing).

You can have as many standalone whiteboards as you need.

= Shared whiteboards =

Shared whiteboards can be used by many visitors at the same time, and they
all see what everyone else draws. This makes the whiteboard an excellent
sharing, communication and teaching platform.

To add a shared whiteboard, you need to subscribe to the
[AWW premium service](http://awwapp.com/blog/plans-and-pricing/) (there's a
30-day free trial period). You will get an API key to enter in your plugin
settings page.
