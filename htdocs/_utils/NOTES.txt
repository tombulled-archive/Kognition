        Member.edit is broken, if change name: invalid rag status --fixed
        If len(class_pin) < LEN Then it started with 0's -> therefore string !!??? || I ATTEMPTED TO FIX THIS. Problem is rooted deep

        //Host name disappears when created is GENUINE BUG - fixed
        table_images

        If edit's are successful, redirect to update. --done

        Host can create infinite classes consecutively -add limit? --doesn't make sense, surely will delete each time

        Move Icons --done

        table_images:
            FILE_NAME
            image_hash
            timestamp_uploaded
            MEMBER_HASH
            QUESTION_HASH

        Add 'timestamp_uploaded' to 'table_images'
            And 'member_hash'?

        Member cant currently retrieve submitted answers.

    ### <//DONE>

    ### <POTENTIAL> :: POTENTIAL ###
        Store die_if_ messages from core_lib in $CFG (and from host_lib, member_lib, ...) ??
            replace with func() || die() ??
        sql_make_ $where only uses AND -> maybe thats fine, can 'hack' it if have to.

        Change all '_' strings to "_"?

        Code an Admin page.

        Cron - Delete in-active clients, clear log.

        make /edit fail if nothing actually specified

        In die_if_assigned_role check there role still exists in db

        they request one thing : give them everything? | in update_() functions, just update everything

        check imports are relevant and essential

        Make request_failed messages part of $cfg | make all die_... see top of core_lib

        Make METHOD_COOKIE for required_param etc. + METHOD_ALL

        make db_lib find() use $where
        make $where use not just '='

        in die_if_... pass api=true for JSON else HTTP error

        make create_default_class

        Check DB is working across devices | Robert Scenario: Does when local?

        Validate, strip, check input
        Add validation to functions

        Clean out comments
        Remove deprecated code
        Check file headers (this file is part of kognition...)
        Organise code | E.g. config_lib !

        Code Cron properly

        Admin:
            Code an Admin page.

            Everything created by Admin disappears when their session is cleared
                | Why should they have to need to create... only view?

            Code Admin logout

        Add built in survey for reviewing prototype (Feedback button)

        Remove unicode cog from everywhere, image...

        Upload code to one-drive

        When host deleted, delete their answers (+ files?)
            Edit cron?
            Check this now that image table updated (on cascade)

        Maybe introduce error codes.

        Push to server

        Potentially redirect members (and hosts?) back to dashboard if root ('/') requested.

        Implement new api

        Limit how many files can be uploaded, e.g. one per question? -> MAX_UPLOAD_FILES?

        Make answer_images note 's'?

        Member can upload 'x' many images. These images are seperate from questions.
        If not seperate from questions
        Once submitted, only teacher see? -no


        Make image_lib.php?

        Been messing with /api/answer/create and /scripts/image/upload

        Need more theory behind image uploading.

        Test sending image to /answer/create

        Make $CFG->DELETE_IF_CHANGED_IP

        Change const server in api.js, find way to 'get' it instead

        Implement api on :
            member/answer
            host/index
            host/landing

        When member gets a list of their questions
            Show which ones have already been answered

        #There are no 'back' buttons!

        If person has created session and GET /, display popup to redirect to /{role}/

        Make $CFG->delete if changed ip | constant for debugging purposes!

        New answer methods: Canvas, multiple choice.

        Implement Roberts Login pages

        Add (and implement) cookie_script on all pages
    ### <//NEXT>

What the app still needs:
    Member:
        #Ability to reset session?
        #Ability to see public classes
        Improved answer page:
            Only show available options
            Allow submit answer (implement API)
    Host:
        Check for joined students in background (API)
        Actually implement host landing page
    _Extra:
        Implement Login/Signup pages
        Re-Do Error pages -> not important
        #Answer survey
        #Remove unicode cogs
        #Thorough testing
